    <h1>What I Want to Learn</h1>
    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">2024-06-23</p>


  <p>inspired by <a href="https://ishanjmukherjee.github.io/learn-more">Ishan Mukherjee’s
blog post</a></p>
<p>Below is a list of concepts and ideas that I would like to explore
further.</p>
<p>Philosophy - platonism - in mathematics, mathematical objects are
independent of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and
practices - in relation to Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems - Eternalism
- Presentism - Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
<p>Economics - Macroeconomics - Took ECON 201: Supply and Demand,
Elasticity, Externalities, Solow Model, Keynesian Cross Model,
Inflation, Monetary &amp; Fiscal policy, Phillips Curve - Microeconomics
- Took ECON 202: Supply and Demand, Elasticity, Trade, Externalities,
Monopoly, Game theory, Interest Rate - Game theory - <a
href="https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159">Open Yale Coure</a> -
https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/pdf/BerJoh13Economic.pdf -
Cryptocurrency - <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">Video from
3B1B</a>seems like a good intro</p>
<p>Quantitative Finance - with python -
https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html - optimization -
https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/webpub/OptFinFirstEdition2006.pdf -
basic - Stephen Blyth’s Introduction to Quantitative Finance - <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quant-hub_quant-finance-glossary-50-terms-risk-activity-7208126671533559808-1yAA/">Terminology</a>
- volatility - Time series analysis - Arbitrage - statistical arbitrage
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-qvFjvyqcs - high-frequency
trading</p>
<p>Physics - Big bang (big chill, big crunch, imaginary time) - - theory
of relativity - - brownian motion - random motion of particles within a
liquid or gas - application of concepts of flux - Quantum mechanics -
first introduced to quantum physics by AI 2041 - interesting
concepts/ideas: double split experiment, qubit (logical/physical),
superposition, entanglement, decoherence - want to understand how basic
concepts are applied in quantum computing</p>
<p>Mathematics - Probability -
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/
- https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/ - stochastic process, stochastic
calculus - statistical mechanics (boltzmann entropy) - Went to
Prof. Tianmin Yu’s NUMS (5/14/25) and basically understood nothing. -
interesting to look into mathematical system that describes
thermodynamics - “Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying
statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest,
carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to
study statistical mechanics.” - Complex Analysis - Tim told me he was
taking 325-0 - studies functions of complex numbers; relevant for
applied mathematics and physics - Fourier analysis - approximation of
general function with trigonometric or exponential functions - Video
from 31B1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY">Fourier
transform</a> - Abstract algebra - number theory (related to
cryptography), geometry - pure mathematics, generalization and finding
structure within mathematics - Graph Theory - briefly introduced in CS
214 through DFS, BFS, trees, Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm - Had
difficult time understanding proofs and concepts especially isomorphism
- combinatorics - story proof, counting, arranging - a really good
advice: “Never move on until you been solve a problem in at least two
different ways.” - linear algebra -
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/ - plan to
take second linear algebra course and study more</p>
<p>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence - Want to learn more about
LLM, particularly interested in interpretability<br />
- focus on ARENA ← basic knowledge - Turing completeness - Jason talked
about <a href="https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf">mov is turing
complete</a> - github repo:
https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator?tab=readme-ov-file - Quantum
Computer - Programming a Quantum Computer seminar by Charles Yuan (March
21, 2025) was very inspiring - would like to explore more in future: how
it works with quantum physics, its application - Cloud Computing - Learn
AWS and software engineering deployment -
https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/ -
Cybersecurity - briefly introduced in CS213 and by Jason - CTF
challenges, virtual environment, hacking, constructing siem - Computer
System - understanding how computer works - there is so much to learn -
