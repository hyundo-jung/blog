inspired by [Ishan Mukherjee’s blog post](https://ishanjmukherjee.github.io/learn-more)

Below is a list of concepts and ideas that I would like to explore further. 

Philosophy
- platonism
	- in mathematics, mathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and practices
		- in relation to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems
- Eternalism
- Presentism
- Ludwig Wittgenstein

Economics
- Macroeconomics
	- Took ECON 201: Supply and Demand, Elasticity, Externalities, Solow Model, Keynesian Cross Model, Inflation, Monetary & Fiscal policy, Phillips Curve
- Microeconomics
	- Took ECON 202: Supply and Demand, Elasticity, Trade, Externalities, Monopoly, Game theory, Interest Rate
- Game theory
	- [Open Yale Coure](https://oyc.yale.edu/economics/econ-159)
	- https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/pdf/BerJoh13Economic.pdf
- Cryptocurrency
	- [Video from 3B1B ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)seems like a good intro

Quantitative Finance
- with python
	- https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html
- optimization
	- https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/webpub/OptFinFirstEdition2006.pdf
- basic
	- Stephen Blyth’s Introduction to Quantitative Finance
	- [Terminology](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quant-hub_quant-finance-glossary-50-terms-risk-activity-7208126671533559808-1yAA/)
	- volatility
	- Time series analysis
	- Arbitrage
		- statistical arbitrage
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-qvFjvyqcs
	- high-frequency trading

Physics
- Big bang (big chill, big crunch, imaginary time)
	- 
- theory of relativity
	- 
- brownian motion
	- random motion of particles within a liquid or gas 
	- application of concepts of flux
- Quantum mechanics
	- first introduced to quantum physics by AI 2041
	- interesting concepts/ideas: double split experiment, qubit (logical/physical), superposition, entanglement, decoherence
	- want to understand how basic concepts are applied in quantum computing

Mathematics
- Probability
	- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/
	- https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/
- stochastic process, stochastic calculus
- statistical mechanics (boltzmann entropy)
	- Went to Prof. Tianmin Yu’s NUMS (5/14/25) and basically understood nothing. 
	- interesting to look into mathematical system that describes thermodynamics
	- “Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics.”
- Complex Analysis
	- Tim told me he was taking 325-0
	- studies functions of complex numbers; relevant for applied mathematics and physics
- Fourier analysis
	- approximation of general function with trigonometric or exponential functions 
	- Video from 31B1: [Fourier transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY)
- Abstract algebra
	- number theory (related to cryptography), geometry
	- pure mathematics, generalization and finding structure within mathematics
- Graph Theory
	- briefly introduced in CS 214 through DFS, BFS, trees, Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm
	- Had difficult time understanding proofs and concepts especially isomorphism
- combinatorics
	- story proof, counting, arranging
	- a really good advice: “Never move on until you been solve a problem in at least two different ways.”
- linear algebra
	- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/
	- plan to take second linear algebra course and study more

Computer Science
- Artificial Intelligence
	- Want to learn more about LLM, particularly interested in interpretability  
	- focus on ARENA ← basic knowledge
- Turing completeness
	- Jason talked about [mov is turing complete](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf)
		- github repo: https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator?tab=readme-ov-file
- Quantum Computer
	- Programming a Quantum Computer seminar by Charles Yuan (March 21, 2025) was very inspiring
	- would like to explore more in future: how it works with quantum physics, its application
- Cloud Computing
	- Learn AWS and software engineering deployment
	- https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/
- Cybersecurity
	- briefly introduced in CS213 and by Jason
	- CTF challenges, virtual environment, hacking, constructing siem
- Computer System
	- understanding how computer works - there is so much to learn
