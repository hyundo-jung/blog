Title: The Consequences of Insufficient Understanding of Artificial Intelligence
Date: 2024-06-22

Reading John Von Neumann and Elon Musk’s concern toward singularity, 
I questioned what possessed danger to humanity. The inability to control artificial intelligence’s development is likely to result from the unknown decision process of artificial intelligence. 

Decision for human is complex process driven by numerous factors. Emotion, one of the largest factor, can not be objectively understood or proven. 

Artificial intelligence, at the moment, does not have emotion, consciousness, or desire. Yet, it is still difficult to understand the conclusion AI arrives. I believe there is two reasons.

1. World is full of exceptions and gray areas. 
2. The data and system is developed by humans with emotions that cannot be fully explained with mathematics and science. 

Thus, I believe the decision and thought process of artificial intelligence will never be completely understood as we still endeavor to understand the minds of our own species. 

However, the danger is that humanity will be influenced by decisions made by AI unconsciously. The sophistication and development of AI will encourage people to believe and trust the decisions made by AI. Indeed, the choices and decisions calculated and made by AI will become more accurate and rational. But, it comes with cost of giving up their freewill and identity. 

It would not occur as if we sign a contract or a document, and many will fail to realize how significantly we were influenced by the decisions of AI. 

I long believed I want to be the individual that attempts to understand AI and develop explainable AI. I also thought it was possible. Yet, I recently acknowledged how flawed I was to understand AI when I can’t even understand myself and others at the first place.

More I try to understand about the world, the world tells what I need to understand more about myself.
